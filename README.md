# HeadlessUI for Sycamore

This is a WIP port of HeadlessUI for Sycamore. It's very WIP, only checkboxes and radio groups are
implemented, and it requires a fork of Sycamore until [https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/548]
can get merged.

I only published this prototype to GitHub to serve as an example use case for that feature.
