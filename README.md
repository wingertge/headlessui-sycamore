# HeadlessUI for Sycamore

This is a WIP port of HeadlessUI for Sycamore. It's very WIP with only a subset of components
currently implemented, with very little testing done aside from usage in my own web app. Now that
`Attributes` has been merged it works with the Sycamore master branch, but a crates.io release for
the feature isn't available yet.

# Progress

Currently implemented components are:
- [x] Menu (Dropdown)
- [x] Listbox
- [x] Combobox
- [x] Checkbox (Toggle)
- [x] Disclosure
- [x] Dialog (Modal)
- [x] Popover
- [x] Radio Group
- [x] Tabs
- [x] Transition

Manual has only been done on `Checkbox`, `Disclosure` and `Radio Group`.
`Dropdown` is both manually and automatically tested.
